SH0RTN.ME Url Shortener Notes
========================================================================

Notes:
------
- App uses a base62 string approach and randomises 5 choices of characters
  to make up the short url slug 
- A check uses optimised query that returns scalar instead or row from db to
  prevent regenerating slug for url that's already in db
- Application is built with flask using jinja templates
- Persistent data store used is PostgreSQL

Prerequisites:
--------------
To run this app locally, the following conditions need to be met.
- A linux environment with
  python3 installed and added to PATH.
- PostgreSQL installed
- url_shortener_db and url_shortener_db database created with PostgreSQL
  ( Db names can be changed as seen fit. The .env/environment file should 
  also be updated accordingly with the new database names)
- PostgreSQL server running on port 5432 
- Populate .env file from .env.sample file with own entries for user 

Assumptions:
-------------
- RDBM to be used
- Not so many users and so random random slug generated
  is limited to 5 characters which allows for up to 65 ^ 5 options
