SH0RTN.ME Url Shortener Notes
========================================================================

Time Spent:
------------
- 3.5 hours
- Coverage 81%

Notes:
------
- App uses a base62 string algorithm that randomises 5 choices of the ascii characters
  to make up the short url slug.
- A check uses optimised query that returns scalar instead or row from db to
  prevent regenerating slug for url that's already in db.
- Application is built with flask using jinja templates
- Persistent data store used is PostgreSQL.

Prerequisites:
--------------
To run this app locally, the following conditions need to be met.
- A linux environment with
  python3 installed and added to PATH.
- PostgreSQL installed
- url_shortener_db and url_shortener_db database created with PostgreSQL
  ( Db names can be changed as seen fit. The .env/environment file should 
  also be updated accordingly with the new database names)
- PostgreSQL server running on port 5432 
- Populate .env file from .env.sample file with own entries for user 

Assumptions:
-------------
- RDBM to be used
- Not so many users and so random random slug generated
  is limited to 5 characters which allows for up to 65 ^ 5 options


How to Run code
-----------------
- clone repository, run `git clone https://github.com/cdvx/url_shortener.git`
- cd into url_shortener, run `cd url_shortener`
- At this point you should be in the root directory of the app, which includes a README.md
  file among others.
- Create a .env file based on the .env.sample file or use the .env files shared via email
  ( to copy from .env.sample files, run `cp .env.sample .env`, Note that a .env file has 
  been created. You can now proceed.)
- Run the setup, run `make setup`
- Run the server, run `make server`
- Run tests, run `make test`
